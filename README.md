# Deep-Learning-Video-Colorization
A deep learning–based video colorization project that automatically converts black-and-white videos into color. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained in the LAB color space to predict chrominance channels from grayscale frames, producing visually plausible colorized video outputs.
